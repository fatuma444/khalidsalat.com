     <h3>The Walking Dead</h3>
     <p>The Walking Dead” is more than just a zombie apocalypse series—it's a deep dive into human survival, morality, 
        and what it means to stay human when everything is falling apart. 
        The raw emotions and gripping characters keep you coming back,
         wondering who will survive the next chapter.

     <h3> Spider-Man: No Way Home (Peter 3 with Iron Man)</h3>
     <p>Spider-Man: No Way Home” brings the multiverse to life in a way that's exciting, nostalgic, 
        and action-packed. Peter 3's bond with Iron Man adds layers of emotion,
         making this movie a perfect blend of superhero thrills and heartfelt moments.
          A must-watch for any Marvel fan!</p>
          <h3>Drive</h3>
          <p>“Drive” is the epitome of stylish, intense filmmaking.
             Ryan Gosling's portrayal of the quiet,
              mysterious driver is magnetic, and the movie's neon-lit atmosphere,
               intense action scenes, and haunting soundtrack make it a timeless piece of cinema.</p>
